# Scripture Spotlight

Scripture Spotlight is a macOS native app that uses App Intents and macOS 26
extended spotlight features to accept input and open it in the JW Library
app.

## Using the App

You can type the following command to open a popup and entry point to enter a
scripture: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>. There is also a top
menu bar icon that looks like an open book that when pressed will open the window.

## Using it in Spotlight

You can enter spotlight using <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> and enter
"Open a Bible Verse." You can add a quick key in spotlight to this such as
"bible" or "scr."
